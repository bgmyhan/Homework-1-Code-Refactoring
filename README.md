# Homework-1-Code-Refactoring

## General info
This project is simple html and css document reconstructed for a homework assignment. Students were meant to refactor the original code to current standards and practices that were discussed in class.

As our first Homework assignment this task was utilized to understand HTML and CSS. To be given existing code and be able to asses, tweak, and improve upon an existing piece of code and do our best to not break the thing.
